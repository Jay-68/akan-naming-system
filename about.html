      <p>
        The naming system of the Akan people is as distinct as that which elders in Togo (the Ewe people), the Ga
        people, Benin (the Fon people), and the African diaspora pass on to toddlers. Other forms of traditional naming
        include middle names, which can refer to order of birth as part of the caste of siblings, twin status, or could
        be an inherited maiden name.

      <h3>The Naming System</h3>
      <p>
        The Akan people use the Kwa language group’s system of timekeeping, which is based on a six-day week, with the
        seventh day inclusive. In Ashanti homes Sunday-born males and females are named Kwasi or Kwesi and Akosua
        respectively (meaning ‘associated with the universe’); Monday-born are Kwadwo or Kojo, Adjoa or Adwoa (meaning
        ‘associated with peace’); Tuesday-born are Kwabena or Kobi, Abena (meaning ‘associated with the ocean’);
        Wednesday-born Kwaku or Kweku, Akua (meaning ‘associated with spider/Ananse’); Thursday-born Yaw, Yaa (meaning
        ‘associated with the earth’); Friday-born Kofi, Afia or Afua (meaning ‘associated with fertility’); and
        Saturday-born Kwame, Ama (meaning ‘associated with God’).

      <h3>Famous Names</h3>
      <p>
        Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system. Ghana‘s first president, Kwame Nkrumah, was born on a
        Saturday, while the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Atta Annan, was so named for being
        born on a Friday. The 25-year-old popular Ghanaian-British fashion model Adwoa Caitlin Maria Aboah is
        Monday-born.
