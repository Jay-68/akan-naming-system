          The naming system of the Akan people is as distinct as that which elders in Togo (the Ewe people), the Ga
          people, Benin (the Fon people), and the African diaspora pass on to toddlers. Other forms of traditional
          naming
          include middle names, which can refer to order of birth as part of the caste of siblings, twin status, or
          could
          be an inherited maiden name.

        <p>
          The Akan people use the Kwa language group’s system of timekeeping, which is based on a six-day week, with the
          seventh day inclusive. In Ashanti homes Sunday-born males and females are named Kwasi or Kwesi and Akosua
          respectively. Monday-born are Kwadwo or Kojo, Adjoa or Adwoa (meaning
          ‘associated with peace’); Tuesday-born are Kwabena or Kobi, Abena (meaning ‘associated with the ocean’);
          Wednesday-born Kwaku or Kweku, Akua (meaning ‘associated with spider/Ananse’); Thursday-born Yaw, Yaa (meaning
          ‘associated with the earth’); Friday-born Kofi, Afia or Afua (meaning ‘associated with fertility’); and
          Saturday-born Kwame, Ama (meaning ‘associated with God’).

          Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system. Ghana‘s first president, Kwame Nkrumah, was born on a
          Saturday, while the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Atta Annan, was so named for being
          born on a Friday. The 25-year-old popular Ghanaian-British fashion model Adwoa Caitlin Maria Aboah is
          Monday-born.
